## I'm currently researching...

<ul>
    <li> Understanding the challenges faced by blind and low-vision people in collaborative exploration and building a prototype using ML to address them.
        <ul>
            <li>Prototype is an Android application that is used for object detection using Yolov5. Currently, the app gives voice feedback on the labels. The code is <a href ="https://github.com/gautham-2803/Object-Detection">here.</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Exploring the challenges of social interactions between blind and low-vision Vision and sighted people, and evaluating emotions to improve them. Read the proposal at <a href ="https://github.com/gautham-2803/gautham-krishna-portfolio/files/13071856/Proposal_Social_interactions.pdf"> Proposal </a>.
  </li>
</ul>
<br/>

## Prior Research
<ul>
  <li> An Arduino prototype (group project) to measure anxiety levels by leveraging sweat, temperature, heartbeat, and accelerometer sensors to send an SOS alert in case of an emergency. To know more, please read <a href="https://github.com/gautham-2803/gautham-krishna-portfolio/files/13095136/HCIN_722__Team_2.pdf">this</a>.</li>
  <li>
    A group project to visualize the growth of electric fuel stations in Washington using Tableau and to predict the shortest route from point A to B in the case of disasters using ArcGIS Pro.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/gautham-2803/gautham-krishna-portfolio/files/13096849/ISTE782_FinalProject_Team3.pdf">Report</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/gautham-2803/gautham-krishna-portfolio/files/13097221/ISTE782_FinalProject_Team3.zip">Tableau</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
A qualitative study was done to understand the different problems faced by international people when exposed to banking in the United States. A survey was conducted to gather the different types of problems and a high-level prototype was designed using Figma.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/gautham-2803/gautham-krishna-portfolio/files/13099143/Commoner_s_problem_in_E_banking.pdf">Initial proposal</a></li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Usability testing for EagleView's application. The group conducted a heuristic evaluation of the web application and provided design recommendations based on Donald Norman's design principles and general UX heuristics. </li>
</ul>
<br/>

## Fun Stuff 
<ul>
  <li>A fun research proposal was made to design a productivity speaker to monitor students who tend to procrastinate and encourage them to focus on the task at hand.
